I've got this code up and running on an ATTiny84 using a Nathan Chantrell designed TinyTX V3 board with RFM12B and have tested it with 2 nodes transmitting data every 10 seconds. 

Seems to work well :)

The board is running off a cheap 12v wall wart utilising a small voltage regulator board I put together as described here http://speciesrace.com/pictures/WallWartReducer/index.htm
