I found that using the LM35 with longish cable runs (even using copper core shielded Cat 5) resulted in erratic temperature readings till I added various passive filtering components. Short runs (a few feet) were no problem and no additional filtering was required.

I've also noticed that using the Arduino with an external (admittedly cheap) PSU also produces erratic readings (although less so than the long cable), it's fine when run off a PC's usb port. I will shortly be starting a project to improve the quality of the cheapo wall warts output with regulation and smoothing. The erratic readings occured with both a 12v wall wart and a 5v usb plug output wall wart.
