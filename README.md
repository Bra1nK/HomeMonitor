HomeMonitor
===========

My Home Monitoring Project

A collection of circuits and Arduino code I use in my Home Monitor which I will add to as items are developed.
I'm currently monitoring Gas and Electric useage, Internal and External temperature and atmospheric pressure.

I've since added a home made rain tipping bucket with magnet and hall effect sensor to detect tips and an ATTiny84 and RFM12B to send the data to my Emoncms running on RaspberryPi
