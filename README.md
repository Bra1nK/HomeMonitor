HomeMonitor
===========

My Home Monitoring Project

A collection of circuits and Arduino code I use in my Home Monitor which I will add to as items are developed.
I'm currently monitoring Gas and Electric useage, Internal and External temperature and atmospheric pressure.

I'm getting a water meter fitted next week so watch this space.
