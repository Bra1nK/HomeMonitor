This circuit is based on the one described at http://www.pcbheaven.com/circuitpages/Long_Range_IR_Beam_Break_Detector/ but modified by me to enable much higher power output with just one additional component (the small signal diode) and a different output transistor.

The first part of the 556 (IC1A), generates pulses of about 30 msec duration, with 1.5 mSec interval (signal frequency is about 32 Hz) and applies this signal to the reset pin of IC1B. As this is a duty cycle below 50% a small signal diode is required in parallel with the 47K resistor (see http://pcbheaven.com/wikipages/555_Theory/?p=1). The second part (IC1B), generates the carrier signal which is 38 KHz and is switched on and off, according to the previous (32Hz) signal. This output is then applied to the 2N3702 output transistor which needs to be able to handle up to 200mA (this just happened to be handy, a suitable modern day alternative would be the 2N5401). In simple words, the IR LED receives a pulse train of 38 KHz, 32 times per second (32 Hz), each time for 1.5mSec. This is the modulated signal. The IR LED is a TST7100 which has a peak wavelength of 950nm and matches well with the receiver. The TST7100 can handle a forward current of 250mA if you can keep it cool enough but in this circuit I'm using around 80mA although 165mA can be selected depending which jumper is chosen but some heatsinking would be advisable to extend the life of the LED.

In practice I found the carrier frequency was some way above the predicted 38 KHz once built on stripboard so added the free running/modulated jumper to allow the frequency to be checked by switching to free running (I used an Arduino for measurement but maybe using an oscilloscope a jumper wouldn't be required to facilitate frequency checking). The 20K preset enables fine adjustment of the carrier frequency.
